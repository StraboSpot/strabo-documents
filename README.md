Strabo is a system to acquire, archive and share data in the Structural Geology Community.  We are developing a user interface system for use on mobile devices (tablets, field-hardended notebook computers) for geologists collecting observations in the field, binding these observations to 'spots'-- locations in the Earth, and sharing data through a community data aggregator data base that is being implemented as a 'multischema' graph database using Neo4j.
