Backlog of development work for the Strabo project.

1.  **Insert spots into photo** >>  Take photo at a spot. Open photo in viewer (can add caption now), have tool to insert spot into photo.  This would require getting the pixel coordinate location in the photo, and passing that along with the photo ID to the form-editor components to allow assocation of any spot description to the spot in the photo.

2. **Edit point location** >> drag point spots or vertices on line or polygon spot path. Can currently replace the geometry for a spot; would like to be able to do more standard kind of graphical editing--click and drag point or vertex.

3. **Streamline create and update forms** >>  Make a single click process to go from updated form design in kobo to activation of updated form design in online Strabo

4. **Select spots to load to mobile** >> select all existing spots in a bounding box, filter by type, project, originator, other criteria...?

5. **Access controls for editing spots** >> Mobile should have spots that are 'read' only (from other users, project etc.), and spots owned by the user that can be edited. Read-only points are refreshed from StraboMaster on sync, mobile client can't modify contents.

6. **Upload georeferenced images for offline** >> Process to create tiles from georeferenced image and push to mobile for offline use, e.g. a geologic map image to add as a base map in the stack, or processed satellite imagery.
